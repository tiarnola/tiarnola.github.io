            <div>
              <p>
                I am a full stack developer with extensive experience in modern
                web technologies. My tech stack includes React and TypeScript
                for frontend, and Node.js, Django and Spring Boot microservices
                for back-end.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                Having graduated in engineering, and subsequently worked as a
                Process Engineer, I made the switch into the programming space
                in 2019 by starting an Interactive Media masters in University
                College Cork.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                Here I garnered an interest in Front-End Development and decide
                to pursue this as a career choice. My first Development job
                arrived with FDM Group in 2022 and here I undertook high
                intensive training in a range of front-end and back-end coding
                languages.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                As a contractor for FDM, I began working for Shell Energy Retail
                in Rotterdam as a Front-End Developer before the company left
                the Dutch Market in 2023. I subsequently returned working
                in-house for FDM Group until March 2024.
